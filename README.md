<h3>#About</h3>
    <p>This is a project designed my Yash Kumar Chandrakar(thats me). The idea of this project is very simple, if you dont
        want to forget something special, you use a timer. This timer allows you to Countdown the exact day,hour,minutes following an
        event. I built this project as a learning experience and as a tool that i can use whenever i need. It was great
        fun building this app and i think i learned a lot from this project. </p>
    <h3>#Usage</h3>
    <p>As i mentioned before this project is designed as a learning practice for me. It is very aesthetic and pleasing
        to the eyes so anyone can use it as a wallpaper as well. I am not thinking of making it as a product in the near
        future as i am sure there are many much better products designed specifically for this purpose. </p>
    <h3>#Features</h3>
    <p>This timer is of very minimalistic design so it has only 5 features :-</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Countdown Box :- Shows the timer and the event thats entered by the user. </li>
        <li>User Input :- User input is taken using a menu that can be hidden with the toggle button. It takes data
            from user such as Event Name & Day of the event.</li>
        <li>Submit Button :- This button submits the data entered by user and starts the Countdown Timer.</li>
        <li>Reset Button :- This button resets the Countdown Timer to the default state with 0 days/hours/mins
            remaining.</li>
        <li>Border On/Off Button :- This button toggles the visibility of border of Countdown Timer for a more aesthetic look.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The hardest thing in my opinion to impelement was the clock. It tooks various tries to get the clock working as
        intended. With the new features being added in like adding user input and reset button made things a little
        challenging but i made it work.</p>
    <h3>#Tools</h3>
    <p>This project was built using only HTML, CSS, and javascript. The design is very simple and plain. Most of the
        time i spent on this project was on making the Countdown work(javascript part). I did want the timer to look
        aesthetically pleasing as well so i invested some time in Css as well. Overall i think the project looks and
        works better than i had hoped .</p>
